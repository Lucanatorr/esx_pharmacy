## How to use

1. Configure values in the config.lua file

	'ShowPlayerLicense',
	'OpenUnpaidBillsMenu',
	'LookupVehicle',
	'OpenVehicleInfosMenu',
	'ImpoundVehicle',
	'createBlip'
}
```

3. Navigate to 'esx_policejob/server/main.lua' **(this is very important)**
  	Anywhere you see:
  ```lua
  	if xPlayer.job.name == 'police'
  ```
  	Add the following: 
  ```lua
  	if xPlayer.job.name == 'police' or if xPlayer.job.name == 'compolice' then
  ```

4. Navigate to 'esx_policejob/client/main.lua' **(this is also very important)**

  	if ESX.PlayerData.job and ESX.PlayerData.job.name == 'police'
  ```
  	Add the following: 
  ```lua
  	if ESX.PlayerData.job and ESX.PlayerData.job.name == 'police' or ESX.PlayerData.job.name == 'compolice' then
  ```
